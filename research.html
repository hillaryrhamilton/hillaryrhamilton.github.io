                        Guided by the contingency model of capacity effectiveness, we examine the relationship between organizational capacities and performance indicators during COVID-19. We conceptualized operational capacity and board leadership capacity as process oriented to ensure organizations’ effective functioning and to demonstrate accountability. Technological capacity and networking capacity were defined as resource oriented to help accomplish organizational goals. We used two effectiveness indicators to capture the input-output success measured by goal attainment and an organization’s ability to learn and adapt to improve its performances based on evaluation data (i.e., professional data use). Survey data collected from nonprofits located in a southeastern U.S. state showed that generally nonprofits were not performing well due to operation challenges. Operational capacity and technological capacity were negatively related to goal attainment; however, these two capacities and board leadership capacity were all positively related to professional data use. Implications describe how to turn a crisis into an opportunity to build resilience. 10.1177/08933189241249759.

                    <p>Guided by the functional theory of group decision-making, we examine how the requisite functions and the addition of different types of cohesion (e.g., task, social, belonging) influence the decision-making process and outcomes. While we conceptualize task requisites consistent with the propositions of the functional theory of group decision-making, decision quality is measured from both the perspective of the decision makers as well as those affected by the decision to understand how decision-quality and its predictors might change depending on perspective. Cross-sectional online retrospective survey data were collected from undergraduate students across a wide variety of majors who were asked to think about a specific decision they made in a group over the past 12 months. Group types included zero history (31%), on-going bona fide (58%) and ad-hoc groups formed solely to make a decision (11%) and were described in both academic (58%) and work/organizational (43%) contexts. Results indicate that task cohesion was a stronger predictor of decision quality than any of the five task requisites outlined in the original functional theory of group decision making. In addition, task requisites varied in their ability to predict decision quality as a function of perspective (e.g., decision-maker, those affected). Theoretical and pragmatic implications are provided along with strategies for how to improve group decision-making processes and related outcomes.</p>
